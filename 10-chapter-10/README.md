## End of Tutorial

This ends the tutorial. Now we have a simple game with physics, sound, and multiple levels. 
There are still features missing, and if you want to continue exploring FXGL you can use 
this game as a starting point. In any case, I wish you luck in your future game creation!

Some obvious features to add or improve:

* Power pills that enable the protagonist to hunt the ghosts
* Improved ghost AI - each ghost having its own personality
* Keeping a high score (the FXGL `SaveLoadService` may come in handy here)

FXGL contains much more than we have covered in this tutorial. Some examples of 
functionality that we have not looked at:

* Event bus
* Mouse support
* Parallax backgrounds
* Cutscenes
* Achievement system
* Notifications
* Advanced AI using decision trees
* Multiplayer support and networking
* Support for web and mobile

On the [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) GitHub pages you can find links to more 
tutorials, both in written format, and in the form of YouTube videos.
